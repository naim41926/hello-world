# Hello-world
Just another repository

Naim Hopkins
Aspiring Software Developer
Java, C++, C.
Traveler, Inventor
And I also like different languages and cultures
I want to learn about analysis and abstract algebra

#Houses
I also want to own around 3 houses, 
2 in the U.S. and 1 in a foreign country and 1 loft.

If I had 150 million I would buy a west coast primary residence, 
an east coast loft, a rural farm house, and nice place to vacation.
